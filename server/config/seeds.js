      "description": "For the first time the complete works of the award-winning author Elizabeth Gilbert are collected together, highlighting her talents as a writer of both fiction and non-fiction. In the international best-seller Eat, Pray, Love, Gilbert narrates her struggles after a bitter divorce and turbulent love affair, beginning her quest to rediscover how to be happy. In Rome, she indulges herself and gains nearly two stone. In India, she finds enlightenment through scrubbing temple floors. Finally, in Bali a toothless medicine man reveals a new path to peace, leaving her ready to find love again. In Committed, Gilbert is about to wed the man she fell in love with at the end of Eat, Pray, Love and with wit and intelligence contemplates marriage, trying with all her might to discover what this stubbornly enduring old institution actually is. In The Last American Man, Gilbert presents a fascinating, intimate portrait of the American naturalist and brilliant modern hero Eustace Conway, who at the age of seventeen ditched the comforts of his suburban existence to escape into the wild. Attempting to instil in people a deeper appreciation of nature, Conway stops at nothing in pursuit of bigger, bolder adventures. In Gilbert's first novel Stern Men, the eighteen-year-old irredeemably unromantic Ruth Thomas returns home from boarding school determined to join the 'stern-men'. Throwing her education overboard, this feisty and unforgettable American heroine helps work the lobster boats and brushes up on her profanity, eventually falling for a handsome young lobsterman. In Pilgrims, Gilbert's sharply drawn and tenderly observed collection of twelve short stories, tough heroes and heroines, hardened by their experiences, struggle for their epiphanies and seek companionship as fiercely as they can.",

I'm so glad I read this book, and I hope every woman gives herself this gift' Reader review ---- Emerson, Georgia, and Marley have been best friends ever since they met at a weight-loss camp as teens. When Emerson tragically passes away, she leaves one final wish for her best friends: to conquer the fears they still carry as adults. For each of them, that means something different. For Marley, it's coming to terms with the survivor's guilt she's carried around since her twin sister's death, which has left her blind to the real chance for romance in her life. For Georgia, it's about learning to stop trying to live up to her mother's and brother's ridiculous standards, and learning to accept the love her ex-husband has tried to give her. But as Marley and Georgia grow stronger, the real meaning of Emerson's dying wish becomes truly clear: more than anything, she wanted her friends to love themselves. A novel of compassion and insight, Good Luck With That tells the story of two women who learn to embrace themselves just the way they are. ---- Real readers have fallen in love with Good Luck with That 'A must read from the very talented Kristan Higgins, who just gets better and better with each book she writes' 5 star reader review 'What a book! Tears were flowing at the end' 5 star reader review 'If ever there was a book that demands to be discussed, it's this one. I wish I were part of a book club because Good Luck with That is the one I'd demand everyone read' 5 star reader review 'Wonderful story. I would highly recommend' 5 star reader review 'The people in this book caught hold of my heart and interest from the first few pages. Finished in three evenings and was sorry when it came to an end.
